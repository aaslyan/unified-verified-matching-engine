/* Differential driver for the generated `orders` table.

 * Replays the two call sequences that `Amcc/Templates/ArrayTableChecks.lean`
 * runs against the Lean semantics (`runCalls`), one result per line. The
 * expected output, `orders_expected.txt`, is transcribed from the checked
 * Lean answers — so a diff failure means the printed C, compiled by a real
 * C compiler, disagrees with `execStmt`.
 *
 * Sequence B runs after sequence A in the same process; that is equivalent
 * to a fresh table because A ends with its only key erased, and a table
 * whose occupancy flags are all false is observationally the zero table:
 * `find` tests the flag before the key, and a claiming `insert` overwrites
 * every field.
