# AMCC — conformance against the real `dmmeta` corpus

*Measured against `/home/aaslyan/openacr-mine/data/dmmeta`, 1420 ctypes and 5659 fields.
Regenerate with `scripts/conformance/run.sh`; every verdict is produced by
`Ssim.Conformance` in Lean, using the shipping reader, the shipping
`supported` list, the shipping `Dmmeta.mangle` and the shipping
`Dmmeta.isCIdent`. The Python under `scripts/conformance/` slices and counts
and decides nothing.*

## The headline

**4848 of 5659 fields (85.7%) would be generated**, and
1419 of 1420 ctypes (99.9%) are
nameable.

The previous measurement said **one**. The difference is entirely
`Dmmeta.mangle`: `dmmeta` names are namespace-qualified, a dot is not a C
identifier character, and until the mapping existed 4518 fields with a
supported reftype were blocked by their *names*. That number is now 64.

What remains is what the first measurement predicted would be second: the
reftypes. 0 fields
(0.0%) have a reftype AMCC has no
representation for, and that is now the *only* thing of any size between the
generator and the corpus.

## Ctypes

| verdict | count | share |
|---|---|---|
| accepted | 1419 | 99.9% |
| mangles to a reserved name | 1 | 0.1% |

## Fields, by what AMCC can do with the reftype

| reftype verdict | count | share | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| generated | 4912 | 86.8% | a template emits operations |
| lowered | 747 | 13.2% | becomes a struct field; no operations |
| rejected | 0 | 0.0% | no representation at all |

## Fields, by what actually blocks them

| blocker | count | share of all fields |
|---|---|---|
| nothing — generated | 4848 | 85.7% |
| the name only (reftype is supported) | 64 | 1.1% |
| the reftype | 0 | 0.0% |

Broken down, the name-only blockers are:

| reason | fields |
|---|---|
| field mangles to a reserved name | 63 |
| not <ctype>.<field> | 1 |

---

## Top reasons for rejection, by how many real fields each blocks

| rank | reason | fields blocked |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the name, after mangling | 64 |

## What the numbers do not capture

The census reads the `dmmeta` record types AMCC models — `dmmeta.ctype`,
`dmmeta.field`, and the attribute tables the join carries (`dmmeta.inlary`,
`dmmeta.smallstr`). `data/dmmeta` has
**109 more that AMCC does not model at all**, carrying
10162 records — 58.4% of the corpus, against
41.6% for the ones AMCC reads. The largest are:

| record type | records |
|---|---|
| `dmmeta.userfunc` | 1655 |
| `dmmeta.ctypelen` | 1333 |
| `dmmeta.cfmt` | 845 |
| `dmmeta.xref` | 789 |
| `dmmeta.cpptype` | 403 |
| `dmmeta.fconst` | 337 |
| `dmmeta.ssimfile` | 301 |
| `dmmeta.finput` | 300 |
| `dmmeta.chash` | 240 |
| `dmmeta.thash` | 239 |

Three of those matter more than their counts suggest, and none of them is a
field-level verdict this census could produce:

- **`dmmeta.xref` (789 records).** Cross-reference
  maintenance is the centre of the library — `docs/GOALS.md` calls it central,
  not peripheral. AMCC models it (`Amcc/Spec/Algebra.lean`) and emits none. A
  field counted "generated" above gets its accessors and *not* its
  participation in the indexes that must be updated when a record is inserted.
  The percentage above therefore overstates what a user would get.
- **Cursors.** Every access pattern in `amc` has one, and they appear in the
  generated API rather than in `data/dmmeta` as their own head, so they are
  invisible to a record census entirely.
- **The ssim layer itself** — `acr`, query mode, `ssimfile` loading,
  `Print`/`ReadStrptrMaybe`, `CopyIn`/`CopyOut`. AMCC reads ssim as a *front
  end* and generates none of the machinery `amc` generates for handling it.

**Every rejection above is now a gap, not a name AMCC never heard of.**
`Dmmeta.Reftype` used to have twenty constructors against `reftype.ssim`'s
thirty-five, so fifteen of the reftypes in this table came back as *unknown* —
which reads as a typo in the corpus rather than as something AMCC does not
model. The vocabulary is complete; the verdicts are unchanged, but they now
mean what they say.

**`Smallstr` is modelled and still counted rejected**, and the distinction is
worth keeping. Its `dmmeta.smallstr` record is read, joined onto the field,
checked (including `amc`'s own 255 ceiling on an `rpascal` length) and printed
back byte-for-byte; `Templates/Smallstr.lean` states all three `strtype`
abstractions and proves `rpascal`'s read-back law. What is missing is
emission: `amc` writes `u8` and the C subset has no eight-bit scalar, so
`Dmmeta.fieldTy` cannot lower the field and `Ssim.supported` does not list the
reftype. `docs/DIVERGENCE.md` §3.8. The census reports what AMCC would
*generate*, so 140 fields stay in the rejected column until that changes —
counting them any other way would be the overstatement this file exists to
prevent.

**The attribute join makes the next few tables cheap, not free.**
`dmmeta.inlary` and `dmmeta.smallstr` go through one registry keyed by
`Dmmeta.AttrTag`, so `bitfld` (75 fields), `charset` (23), `lenfld`, `substr`
and `fconst` (337 records) each need a payload arm and nothing else. That is
the *join*. Each still needs its own lowering and its own law before this
table moves.

**The census does not model the layout at all.** It answers "would AMCC name
and represent this field", and says nothing about whether the *program* built
from the ctype it belongs to passes `CSubset.Wf.check`. Since e08a3e8 the
structure templates emit the whole lowered table, so a ctype whose fields all
count as generated still produces nothing unless a template runs over it —
`Templates.Layout.layoutCheck`, not this census, is where "can be lowered
today" is decided. The headline is an upper bound in that direction too.

**The census is per-record and misses the whole-schema clauses.**
`Dmmeta.check` has three checks that need every ctype and field at once — two
mangled names colliding, two qualified names colliding, and a field named what
a template would generate — and `Ssim.Conformance.classify` decides one tuple
at a time. So the generated count above is an **upper bound** on that axis too.
The last of the three is known to bite in the corpus: `c_next` alongside a
field `c`, and `line_n` alongside `line` (5 of those), are exactly the shape
`clashesGenerated` rejects. Under ten fields, but not zero, and the census
does not currently show them.

Two further caveats on the reading of the table:

- A "generated" verdict is about the reftype and the names, not about the
  whole ctype. A ctype whose fields are individually fine can still fail
  `Dmmeta.check` — for the layout-acyclicity rule, for a duplicate qualified
  name — and the census does not run the whole-schema check, because the
  corpus does not get far enough for it to mean anything.
- `Val` dominates the corpus (2936 fields, 51.9% of the
  total), and a `Val` whose `arg` is a ctype AMCC cannot lower —
  `algo.cstring`, `algo_lib.Replscope` — is counted here by its reftype and
  would still fail at lowering. The number is an upper bound.
