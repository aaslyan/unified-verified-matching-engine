# AMCC — Phase 2: the schema DSL

The generator's *input* language: what a user writes to describe a table.

This file deliberately knows nothing about the C subset beyond borrowing its
scalar types, and nothing at all about any template. A schema is a description
of data, not of code; which template consumes it is Phase 3's business.

## The `Reftype` vocabulary

`Reftype` names the *structural role* a field plays, which is the idea AMCC
takes from OpenACR's `dmmeta.reftype`: the same field type means different
generated code depending on whether it is a key, a value, or a link. Two
constructors is the whole vocabulary for now — `Pkey` and `Val` — because the
Phase 3 template can only act on those two, and a constructor with no template
to interpret it would be decoration. `Upptr`/`Ptrary`-style link reftypes are
what a Phase 5 intrusive-list template would add.

## Reserved names

The generator synthesises C names from the table name (see `Names`), one struct
field — the slot-occupancy flag — that has no schema counterpart, and a handful
of local temporaries. `check` rejects any schema whose field names would
collide:

- with the occupancy flag, by name; and
- with a temporary, by reserving the entire **leading-underscore** namespace
  for generated locals. One rule instead of a list the generator could outgrow
  — a template that needs another temporary just prefixes it.

Collecting the generated names in `Names` rather than spelling them out at each
use site is what keeps the collision check and the generator from drifting
apart.

namespace Schema

abbrev Ident := String

/-- The structural role of a field. See the module docstring on why this is
only two constructors. -/
inductive Reftype where
  /-- Stored by value; no structural role. -/
  | Val
  /-- The table's unique primary key. Exactly one field must have this. -/
  | Pkey
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited, BEq

/-- Field types are the C subset's scalar types.

Not a separate type language: the Phase 3 template stores fields in a struct
and compares keys with `==`, so anything it could express would map one-to-one
onto `CSubset.ScalarTy` anyway. A template that needs strings or nested records
is the point at which this should fork. -/
abbrev FieldTy := CSubset.ScalarTy

structure Field where
  name    : Ident
  ty      : FieldTy
  reftype : Reftype
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

end Schema

/-- A schema: one table.

`capacity` is part of the schema rather than the template because it decides
the generated array's size, and array sizes are literals in the C subset — so
a schema fixes a program, not a family of them. -/
structure Schema where
  name     : Schema.Ident
  capacity : Nat
  fields   : List Schema.Field
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

namespace Schema

/-! ## Derived views -/

/-- The primary key field, if the schema has exactly one. -/
def pkey? (s : Schema) : Option Field :=
  match s.fields.filter (fun f => f.reftype == .Pkey) with
  | [f] => some f
  | _   => none

/-- The non-key fields, in declaration order. -/
def valFields (s : Schema) : List Field :=
  s.fields.filter (fun f => f.reftype == .Val)

/-- Every C name a schema generates.

One place, so that `check`'s collision test and Phase 3's generator cannot
disagree about what gets emitted. -/
structure Names where
  /-- `struct <name>_row` — one slot of the table. -/
  row      : Ident
  /-- `static <row> g_<name>[CAP]` — the storage. -/
  storage  : Ident
  /-- The slot-occupancy flag. Has no schema counterpart, which is why it is
  the one name `check` must reserve. -/
  occupied : Ident
  find     : Ident
  insert   : Ident
  erase    : Ident
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- `<table>_get_<field>` — **no longer generated**.

Per-field getters existed only because the C subset had no null pointer: a
`Find` returning `<row> *` had nothing to return for an absent key, so it
returned a slot index with a sentinel and each field got its own accessor.
That API could not distinguish an absent key from a zero value, and reading an
`n`-field row cost `n` lookups. `NULL` exists now, so `Find` returns a row
pointer and fields are read through it, as in `amc`.

The name is still reserved by `check`, so a schema cannot introduce a field
that would collide if per-field accessors return. -/
def getterName (s : Schema) (field : Ident) : Ident := s.name ++ "_get_" ++ field

def names (s : Schema) : Names where
  row      := s.name ++ "_row"
  storage  := "g_" ++ s.name
  occupied := "occupied"
  find     := s.name ++ "_Find"
  insert   := s.name ++ "_InsertMaybe"
  erase    := s.name ++ "_Remove"

/-! ## Well-formedness -/

/-- One past the largest capacity a `uint32_t` slot index can address. Matches
`CSubset.Wf.u32Bound`; the two are the same constraint seen from the input and
output ends. -/

/-- A legal C identifier that is not a keyword.

Checked here rather than in Phase 4 because these strings come from *user
input*: a schema is where a bad name enters the system, and rejecting it at the
door beats emitting C that will not compile. -/

/-- Reserved for the generator's local temporaries. Spelled with `toList`
rather than `String.startsWith` because the latter iterates UTF-8 byte
positions and does not reduce in the kernel — which would cost every schema
check in this file its `rfl` proof. -/

Same shape as `CSubset.Wf.check`, and for the same reason: the consumer is a
generator, and "which rule, where" is what makes a failure actionable. -/
