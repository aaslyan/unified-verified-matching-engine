# AMCC — Phase 1: values, access paths and stores

The state a C-subset program runs against. Three deliberate choices, each of
which pays for itself in the proofs downstream:

**Storage is structured, not bytes.** A `Value` is a word, a pointer, a struct
of named fields, or a list of elements — never an array of octets. Nothing in
the subset can observe layout (no casts at pointer type, no arithmetic on
pointers, no unions), so byte-level modelling would add padding and alignment
obligations that no theorem could ever use. If a later template genuinely needs
layout reasoning, that is a change to this file and nothing else.

**A pointer is an access path**, `Path` — a global's name plus a list of
resolved steps. This is exactly the "global-rooted" invariant from Phase 0's
obligation 7, made into a data type: a value of type `Path` cannot express a
null pointer, an interior offset, or a reference into a frame. Alias testing
between two paths is a prefix comparison, with no arithmetic in it.

**Frames hold only scalars and pointers.** `Store.loc` maps names to values of
`ValTy`, so a local has no interior structure to index into. Together with the
absence of `&local`, that is what makes a local assignment observably local.

Struct fields are represented with the same `Env` type as a frame, so the two
update lemmas proved once for `Env` serve both.

namespace CSubset

/-! ## Access paths -/

/-- One step of an access path. Array steps carry a *resolved* index: bounds
are checked when the step is built (`Eval.resolve`), not when it is followed,
which is what makes `&a[i]` trap on a bad `i` rather than producing a pointer
that traps later. -/
inductive PathStep where
  | fld : Ident → PathStep
  | idx : Nat → PathStep
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited, BEq

/-- What an access path is rooted at.

Originally this was just a global's name, which made *every* pointer point at
statically declared storage and forced every table to have a capacity fixed at
compile time. That restriction is gone: a path may now root at a **heap
block**, identified by the number it was allocated under.

Block identity is a `Nat`, not an address. Nothing in the language can compute
one, compare it arithmetically, or forge it — the only way to obtain a block
root is from an allocation that succeeded. Freeing removes the block from the
heap, so a stale path stops resolving rather than silently reading whatever
moved in. -/
inductive Root where
  /-- Statically declared storage; outlives every frame. -/
  | glob : Ident → Root
  /-- A heap block, by the identity it was allocated under. -/
  | blk  : Nat → Root
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited, BEq

/-- A rooted access path — the runtime meaning of a pointer.

Still non-dangling *by construction* in the sense that matters: a `Path` names
an object or it names a block that has been freed, and the latter is a
distinguishable error rather than undefined behaviour. -/
structure Path where
  root  : Root
  steps : List PathStep
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited, BEq

/-- Two paths denote overlapping storage exactly when one refines the other.
No arithmetic, no aliasing analysis — a prefix test. -/
def Path.overlaps (p q : Path) : Bool :=
  p.root == q.root && (p.steps.isPrefixOf q.steps || q.steps.isPrefixOf p.steps)

/-- `Path.overlaps` compares with `==`, and `List.isPrefixOf` does too, so the
frame theorem below needs the derived `BEq`s to agree with equality. The
`deriving` handler does not register that, and `simp` cannot see through the
generated matcher without it. -/

/-! ## Values -/

/-- Runtime values.

`u8`/`u32`/`u64` are Lean's wrapping machine words, which is precisely C's
defined behaviour for `uint8_t`/`uint32_t`/`uint64_t`. There is no null pointer constructor —
`ptr` carries a `Path`, and every `Path` denotes an object. -/
inductive Value where
  | u8    : UInt8 → Value
  | u32   : UInt32 → Value
  | u64   : UInt64 → Value
  | bool  : Bool → Value
  /-- The null pointer.

  Added because **allocation can fail**, and a language that models dynamic
  storage has to be able to say so. This is the one place the Phase 0 bet is
  deliberately weakened: dereferencing null is now a reachable error, so
  "exactly one partial operation" becomes three (out-of-range subscript, null
  dereference, use-after-free). All three remain *proof obligations on
  generated code* — the same discipline over a bigger surface, rather than a
  restriction that made real data structures inexpressible. -/

A finite map keyed by identifier, backed by an association list — used both for

has run. -/

/-! ### Allocation

The whole point of the heap. `allocBlock` is total — refusing an allocation is
the *caller's* decision, taken by consulting an allocator oracle, not
something the store model decides. That keeps the store a faithful record of
memory and leaves "malloc may return null" where it belongs: in the
semantics of the allocation statement. -/

/-- Allocate a block holding `v`, returning the store and a path to it.
The identity is `σ.next`, which is fresh by construction. -/
def Store.allocBlock (σ : Store) (v : Value) : Store × Path :=
  ({ σ with hp := (σ.next, v) :: σ.hp, next := σ.next + 1 }, ⟨.blk σ.next, []⟩)

/-- Free a block. The identity is *not* returned to the pool of fresh names,
so every path into it stays permanently unresolvable. -/
def Store.freeBlock (σ : Store) (b : Nat) : Store :=
  { σ with hp := σ.hp.filter (fun kv => !(kv.1 == b)) }

/-- A dynamically sized array value: `n` copies of `z`, with `n` a **runtime**
quantity. This is what the fixed-capacity design could not express — the size
lives in the value, not in the type. -/
def Value.arrOf (n : Nat) (z : Value) : Value := .arr (List.replicate n z)

/-! ### Memory that outlives a call

The state that persists across calls. It used to be just `Env` — the globals —
which is precisely why every table's storage had to be statically declared.
Now it carries the heap too, so what a program owns between calls is no longer
fixed when the program is written. -/

/-! ## Zero initialisation

C zero-initialises objects with static storage duration, so the initial store
is determined by the program's declarations alone. The recursion below is
structural because Phase 0's obligation 2 makes struct nesting
backward-referencing: each struct's zero value is built from the zero values of
the structs *already* in the table. That is the obligation earning its keep —
without it this function would need fuel. -/

/-- The zero value at a storage type, given zero values for the structs
declared so far.

Pointer type zeroes to `NULL`, which is what C guarantees for a pointer with
static storage duration. This used to be `none` — there was no null pointer,
so a pointer had no zero, so a global could not contain one. That restriction
is gone, and with it the reason a list could not be rooted in a global head
pointer. -/
