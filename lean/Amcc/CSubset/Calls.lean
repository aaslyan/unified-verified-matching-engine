# AMCC — reasoning about a call, template-independently

The lemmas every operation template needs before it can say anything about a
generated function, factored out of the first template that needed them
(`Templates/Upptr.lean`) when the second one (`Templates/Llist.lean`) needed
them too.

Three groups.

**Peeling one statement.** `simp only [execAt]` unfolds all the way down, which
loses any hypothesis stated one level up — about `resolve`, or `evalExpr`, or a
sub-statement. `execAt_seq` and friends rewrite exactly one constructor and
stop, which is what lets those hypotheses match. This is the single most
recurrent friction in the proofs above them.

**Resolving a name to a definition.** `lookupFun_of_mem`: a function that is in
the program resolves to itself, provided the generated names do not collide.
Collision is a whole-schema property, so it stays a hypothesis.

**Getting in and out of a call.** `callFun_normal` / `callFun_ret` run a body
whose frame is known, at a depth budget the program's own function count
supplies.

`Amcc/Templates/ArrayTable*.lean` predates this file and carries its own copies
under `Templates.ArrayTable`; they were not moved because they are load-bearing
in proofs that are finished, and churn there buys nothing.

/-! ## Writing a local

Every template's generated code assigns to its own temporaries, and a local
assignment is the one store update that touches no memory at all. These four
say so, once: the step itself, that it leaves every path alone, and how the
frame reads back. They were written inside `Templates.Llist` first and moved
here when `Thash`'s chain walk needed the same four — they are about the
subset, not about any structure. -/

/-! ## Reading memory between calls

function observes is a function of the `Mem` alone — which is what persists
across a call. -/

prefix, so inequality of generated names reduces to inequality of suffixes. -/

/-- A function in a program with pairwise-distinct names resolves to itself.

Name distinctness stays a hypothesis because it is a property of the *whole*
schema, not of any one template: `child ++ "_" ++ fld` is not injective in the
pair, so `a`/`b_c` and `a_b`/`c` generate the same C name. That is the schema
checker's business, and making it a hypothesis says so instead of hiding it. -/

/-! ## Acceptance discharges resolution, once

`lookupFun_of_mem`'s side condition is a whole-schema property, and
`Wf.check`'s third clause is where that property is decided. So a single
`Wf.check p = []` — which each template's `genWellFormed` derives from
`Dmmeta.check d = []` — supplies the `hlook` hypothesis of *every* law about
*every* function of `p`, instead of each schema discharging it by computation.

Split by outcome rather than stated with a `match`, because a `match` on the
outcome in the conclusion makes the rewrite motive dependent. -/
