# AMCC — Phase 3: the array table, exercised

What is checked here, and what it is worth.

**Proved generically (all schemas):** `absOf_eq_empty` — a table with no
occupied slot abstracts to the empty map.

**Checked by computation (the two example schemas):** that `genC` emits code the
C subset accepts, and that running that code behaves like a map. Most are
`rfl`, so they are kernel-checked equalities rather than tests — but they are
about *these* schemas, not all of them, and that distinction is the whole point
of the project. They are evidence the generator is right, not proof.

One check — the full-table and slot-reuse path — is `#guard` rather than
`rfl`. Kernel-normalising that run was measured at over 23 GB of memory before
an out-of-memory panic (the failing insert makes both scans run dry over a full
store, the interpreter's worst case), while compiled evaluation finishes it in
a quarter of a second. `#guard` still runs during `lake build`, so the
verification signal is unchanged; the trust base for that one check is the
compiler rather than the kernel — an acceptable trade for what is explicitly
evidence, not proof.

The cross-check that earns the most is `absOf_after_insert`: `absOf` is written
independently of `genC`, so if the abstraction function disagreed with the
layout the generator actually emits — a wrong field name, the occupancy flag in
the wrong place, the value tuple in the wrong order — that theorem would fail.
It is the one place the two halves of Phase 3 are forced to agree.

`MilestoneTheorem` is now **proved** (`Templates.ArrayTable.milestoneTheorem`,
in `ArrayTableInsert.lean`), so these examples are no longer the only evidence
that the template is right. They are kept because they check something the
milestone does not: that the *concrete* schema in `Schema.Examples` computes,
by kernel reduction, the answers the abstract statement predicts — which is
what `scripts/smoke.sh` then replays against a real C compiler.

/-! The full-table and slot-reuse path: fill all four slots, watch the fifth
insert fail with nothing changed, erase, and watch the next insert reclaim the
freed slot. This is the interpreter's worst case — the failing insert runs both
scans to exhaustion over a full store — which is why it is `#guard` (compiled
evaluation) and not `rfl` (kernel normalisation): see the module docstring.
