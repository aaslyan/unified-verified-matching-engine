# AMCC — the up-pointer template is well-formed for every accepted schema

`Templates/Upptr.lean` had `Wf.check … = []` only as a computation on one
sample schema. This closes the gap: **every** schema `Dmmeta.check` accepts
generates a program `CSubset.Wf.check` accepts.

That matters beyond tidiness. `scripts/gen/upptr_gen.h` tells a reader that
what each function is guaranteed to do is machine-checked *for every accepted
schema*, and until this theorem existed that sentence was true of the array
table and overstated for this one. The banner is right; the proofs were behind
it.

## The shape

Three parts, and only the third is specific to up-pointers:

- the struct table and the global, from `Layout.checkStructs_gen` and
  `Layout.checkGlobals_gen`;
- function-name distinctness, from `NameWf` — a `flatMap` of four-name blocks
  over the `Upptr` fields, with the qualified prefixes distinct by
  `Dmmeta.check` and the four suffixes pairwise non-overlapping;
- `checkFun` for each of the four bodies. Each is one statement over a
  dereferenced row, so the only real obligation is that `row->f` types to
  `parent *` — which is `NameWf.ctx_field?` composed with
  `NameWf.fieldTy_upptr`, and which is exactly what the `needsRecordArg`
  clause added to `Dmmeta.check` makes true.

`Upptr.lookups_of_wf` takes `Wf.check (genUpptr d) = []`, which a consumer used

acceptance is the only hypothesis, and the four resolutions for a given field
come out together. -/
