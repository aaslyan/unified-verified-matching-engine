# AMCC — the `Upptr` template

The second operation template over the ctype model, and the first one whose
whole content is a **pointer field**: `dmmeta.reftype Upptr` is a cached
reference from a child row to its parent row.

## What `amc` does

`cpp/amc/upptr.cpp` is nineteen lines. It declares the member —

```cpp
InsVar(R, field.p_ctype, "$Cpptype*", "$name", "", "reference to parent row");
```

— and generates one function, `Init`, whose entire body is
`$parname.$name = NULL;`. There is no getter: the member is public, and the
cross-reference code assigns it directly (`row.p_target = p_target;` in
`targsrc_XrefMaybe`, quoted in `docs/DIVERGENCE.md` §1.1).

## What AMCC emits, and why it is four functions rather than one

The member is already there — `Dmmeta.fieldTy` lowers `Upptr` to
`.ptr (.strct arg)`, so `Dmmeta.structOf` puts it in the struct and C code can
still write `row->p_parent` directly. Nothing about `amc`'s surface is lost.

What is *added* is that each of the three things C code would otherwise do by
hand becomes a function:

```c
void        C_f_Init(C *row);          /* row->f = NULL;        — amc's Init */
Parent*     C_f_Get(C *row);           /* return row->f;                     */
void        C_f_Set(C *row, Parent *p);/* row->f = p;   — what XrefMaybe does */
bool        C_f_Q(C *row);             /* return row->f != NULL;             */
```

The reason is the project's, not `amc`'s: a function is where a proof
obligation can be attached. `upptr_get_set` below says a `Get` after a `Set`
returns exactly what was set — the read-back law — and `upptr_frame` says a
`Set` through one pointer cannot be observed through a non-overlapping one.
Neither statement can be made about a bare member assignment, because there is
no generated function to make it about. This is a divergence in surface and it
is recorded in `docs/DIVERGENCE.md`.

`Q` is the C form of `cget.cpp`'s `$FieldQ`, which for a pointer field returns
the pointer in boolean context.

## The one precondition

Every one of the four dereferences `row`. In the C subset that is a partial
operation twice over — `nullDeref` if the argument is `NULL`, `useAfterFree` if
its root block is gone — so every theorem below carries `RowAt`, which says the
argument really names a row that has the field. That is the whole obligation,
and it is exactly `amc`'s unstated contract that a caller must not pass a
dangling child row.

/-- **Acceptance discharges the resolution hypothesis.**

Every law below assumes `lookupFun p nm.x = .ok (xDef …)`. That hypothesis is
satisfiable exactly when the generated function names are distinct, and
`CSubset.Wf.check` is where distinctness is decided — obligation 1, the
`distinct "function"` clause. So a program the C subset accepts always
supplies it, via `CSubset.lookupFun_of_mem`.

The schema-level guard that makes acceptance reachable is new in
`Dmmeta.check`: `c ++ "_" ++ f` is **not** injective in the pair — ctype `a`
with field `b_c` and ctype `a_b` with field `c` both qualify to `a_b_c` — so
without it a legal schema could emit two functions with one name, and every
law here would be vacuous for that schema with nothing to notice.

/-! ## The laws

Each is stated against an arbitrary program in which the name resolves to the
definition — the same shape the array table's body lemmas take, and for the
same reason: what the function does is independent of what else the program
contains. `lookupFun_of_mem` above turns "the schema declares this field" into
that hypothesis.

`RowAt` is the shared precondition: the argument names a row that has the
field. It is what discharges both pointer traps, and it is `amc`'s unwritten
contract made explicit. -/

/-- The argument names a row whose up-pointer field currently holds `v`. -/

/-- Resolving `row->f` when `row` really names a row that has `f`. Both of the
subset's pointer traps are discharged here: `nullDeref` because the local holds

the root resolves *because* the field does, which is the whole content of
`RowAt`. -/
