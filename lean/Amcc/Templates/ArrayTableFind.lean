# AMCC — `find`, proved against the semantics

The first refinement proof in the project: reasoning about `execStmt` on a
*generated* body, under `RepInv`, to establish what the function computes.

Everything proved so far about generated code has been **structural** —
`GenWellFormed` says the checker accepts it, `Wf.check` says the shapes fit.
Nothing has said what any generated function *does*. This file is where that
starts, and `find` is the right place to start it: `insert`, `erase` and the
abstraction all call `find`, so no other clause of `Simulates` is reachable
without it.

## Why this order

The plan deferred this behind `TypeSound` and the semantics rework. That was
the wrong call, for a reason worth recording: the technique — loop-invariant
reasoning over `forLoop`, with the error cases discharged from `RepInv` — is
what transfers to every later template. Deferring it left the project's
central claim untested while everything else was built on the assumption that
it would work.

`TypeSound` is deliberately **not** used. It is a general
progress-and-preservation argument over `Step`; for one template the shapes are
pinned by `RepInv` directly, so the structural errors are discharged where they
arise rather than by a theorem that does not exist yet.

## The obligations, bottom up

1. `resolve_slot` — the loop's `g_<t>[_i]` resolves to the path it should.
2. `resolve_field` / `read_field` — a field of that slot reads back what the
   invariant says is there.
3. the guard evaluates to the occupancy-and-key test.
4. `forLoop` induction: scanning `[i, i+rem)` returns the first match.
5. `FindCorrect`.

All five are established: `findCorrect` at the bottom discharges
`ArrayTable.FindCorrect`. It is the project's first theorem about what
generated code **computes**, as opposed to whether the checker accepts it.

/-! ## Reading the loop variable

`evalIndex` goes through `UInt32.toNat`, so every slot lemma needs the
round-trip. It holds because `Schema.check` bounds the capacity by `2³²`, which
is exactly why that clause is in the checker. -/

/-! ## Resolving a slot

The first genuine step: `g_<t>[_i]` denotes slot `i` of the storage array.
Every clause of `RepInv` that matters shows up here — `storage` gives the
array, and the length clause is what turns `i < capacity` into an in-range
subscript, which is the whole no-trap argument for this template. -/

/-- **The slot resolves, and does not trap.**

The `oob` case is discharged by `RepInv.length`: the array really is
`capacity` long, so a loop bounded by the capacity cannot leave it.

unnecessary for this template. -/

`find` compares the row's key field against the argument with `==`, and
`evalBin .eq` is only defined when both operands are the *same* scalar
constructor. So the comparison only evaluates at all when the key argument has
the primary key's type — which is a precondition `FindCorrect` does not
currently carry. See the note at the bottom. -/

on this is the whole content of the step.

induction go.

This is the step where per-iteration reasoning becomes a statement about the

`firstMatch` is an index; `absOf` is a `List.find?`. Relating them is what
turns "the loop stopped at slot `j`" into "the key is in the table". -/

It returns a pointer to a slot, or `NULL`, and it is a pointer exactly when

unchanged, because the scan writes only the loop variable and nothing else in
the function writes at all.

This is the project's first theorem about what generated code *computes*, as
opposed to whether the checker accepts it.

`insert` and `erase` both do their work through the pointer `find` handed
back: `_at->f = v`. Resolving that is the write-side counterpart of
`resolve_field`, and the interesting difference is which errors have to be
discharged — a `deref` can fail with `nullDeref` or `useAfterFree`, neither of
which arises for the index-rooted `g[_i].f` form. Both are ruled out here by
the pointer coming from `find`: it points at a live slot of the storage
array. -/

/-! ## Writing a slot's field

What a write through `_at->f` does to the storage array, as an equation about
`rowsOf`. This is the shared foundation for `insert` and `erase`: both do
exactly one field write per affected slot, and both then have to argue that
`RepInv` survives it. -/

/-- **A field write updates exactly that slot, and nothing else.**

The frame content — that the rest of the array is untouched and the local
frame is untouched — is what makes the invariant's other clauses survive, and
it comes from `List.set` rather than from any aliasing analysis, because the
path is rooted at a global and resolved.

/-! ## Clearing occupancy

What `erase` does to a row. The point of these is that writing the occupancy
flag disturbs **nothing else** about the row — not its key, not its value
fields — which is what makes `RepInv`'s `rows` clause survive and what makes
`absOf` change in exactly the way `Abs.erase` says.

They rest on the schema check's no-`occupied`-collision rule: a field named
`occupied` would make the write clobber a real field instead. That rule has
been in `Schema.check` since Phase 2 and this is the first place it is
*used*. -/

/-- **The representation invariant survives an erase.**

All four clauses, and they are not equally hard:

- `storage` and `length` are immediate — `List.set` does not change length.
- `rows` is `rowOk_set_occupied` applied pointwise.
- `distinct` is **free**, and worth spelling out why: clearing a flag can only
  *shrink* the occupied set, so any two occupied slots in the new array were
  occupied in the old one, where the invariant already forced them equal. An
  erase cannot create a key collision. This is the clause that will carry real
  content for `insert`, which writes a key rather than clearing a flag.

/-- **An erase removes exactly that key from the abstraction.**

Two cases, and only one has content. For the erased key, `distinct` does the
work: slot `i` was the *only* occupied slot holding it, so once its flag is
cleared nothing answers for that key. For every other key, nothing that could
have answered moved — slot `i` did not match those keys before the clear
either, since its key was `k`.

/-! ## Calling `find` from another generated function

`insert` and `erase` both begin with `_at = <t>_Find(pk);`. That goes through
`execAt`'s `.call` case, which no proof has needed until now: it evaluates the
arguments, builds the callee's frame, runs the body one call-depth down,
**restores the caller's frame**, and writes the result into the destination
local.

The frame restore is the interesting part, and it is sound for the reason
Phase 0 was designed around: no pointer can name a frame, so discarding the
callee's frame wholesale cannot lose anything the caller could observe. -/

/-- **Calling `find` binds `_at` to what `find` returned, and changes nothing
else.**

/-! ## The `_at != NULL` guard

The test `insert` and `erase` both make on what `find` returned. Two lemmas
rather than one because `evalBin .ne` is defined by cases on the operands, and
the two cases are what the two branches of the generated `if` correspond to. -/

/-! ## What this file is for

Everything above is a bank: the resolve/read/write lemmas, the scan, and
`exec_callFind`. `FindCorrect` and `NoTrapFind` are discharged here; the
writers are discharged in `ArrayTableErase` and `ArrayTableInsert`, and both
are built entirely from lemmas proved above.

Two notes on what the bank had to contain, because neither was obvious before
the proofs demanded them.

`resolve_ptrField` and `read_ptrField` handle `_at->f` for a pointer that came
from `find`, which is what rules out `nullDeref` and `useAfterFree` — neither
of which could arise for the index-rooted `g[_i].f` form, so they are
genuinely new obligations, not restatements.

`write_slotField` gives the write itself: a field update replaces exactly that
slot and leaves the rest of the array, the frame and the heap alone. The frame
content comes from `List.set`, not from any aliasing analysis, because the
path is rooted at a global and already resolved. That is what lets `RepInv`'s
`distinct` clause — the only global one — transfer slot by slot in both
writers.

## Two findings about `FindCorrect` as originally stated

Both were defects in the *statement*, discovered by trying to prove it, and
both had to be fixed before it could be true. They are kept on record because
"the proof found a bug in the specification" is the return this project is
built to get.

**It described the old API.** `ArrayTable.FindCorrect` said `find` returns
`.u32 (UInt32.ofNat i)` with `i ≤ capacity` and `i < capacity` meaning
"present". `find` returns a row pointer, or `NULL` when absent, so the clause
was restated in those terms.

**It was false as written.** It quantified over *every* `Interface.Key`, with
no constraint relating the key to the primary key's type. `evalBin .eq` is
defined only on matching scalar constructors, so searching a `u64`-keyed table
with a `.bool` key does not return "absent" — it raises `typeErr`. The
statement needed `k.ty = pk.ty` as a hypothesis, which `eval_guard` above
carries. A clause that cannot be discharged is worth more than one
that looks discharged, and this one was hiding in plain sight until the
comparison had to be evaluated. -/
