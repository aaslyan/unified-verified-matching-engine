# AMCC — the layout pass is well-formed for every lowerable schema

`Templates/Layout.lean` states `LayoutWellFormed`; this module proves it.

It is the shared foundation of item B: `Upptr`, `Llist` and `Thash` all emit
`Dmmeta.genStructs` and `Dmmeta.genGlobals`, so each of their
every-schema well-formedness proofs would otherwise have to redo the struct
and global obligations from scratch. Done once here, each template is left
with only its own functions to discharge.

## The hole this proof found

`LayoutWellFormed` was **false as stated** when this file was started, and the
counterexample is small: a schema with an `Inlary` whose declared bound is `0`
passed `Dmmeta.check` *and* `Layout.layoutCheck`, and the generated program was
then rejected by `CSubset.Wf.check` with `"D.row: bad array size"`. The
schema-level clause only asked that a bound *exist*; obligation 3 asks that it
be a legal C array size.

The fix is in the checker, not in the theorem: `Dmmeta.checkField` now rejects
a bound outside `(0, u32Bound)`, with two negative examples pinning the exact
message. That is the direction `docs/GOALS.md` requires — the front end must
not accept what the back end cannot emit — and it is the finding this item was
asked to look for.

## The three obligations, and where each comes from

- **Struct names distinct** — `genStructs` maps the non-scalar ctypes of
  `withBuiltins` to structs of the same name, so the name list is a *sublist*
  of `Db.names`, which `Dmmeta.check`'s `dups full.names = []` clause makes
  pairwise-distinct.
- **Field names distinct, per struct** — `structOf` is a `filterMap` over the
  ctype's fields that preserves names and order, so again a sublist, of a list
  `checkCtype`'s `dups` clause makes distinct.
- **Sizes, resolution and nesting** — one case analysis over `fieldTy`. Every
  lowered type is `scalar`, `strct n`, `ptr (strct n)` or `arr (strct n) k`,
  and each of the three obligations is read off the reftype: `sizesOk` needs
  the `Inlary` bound (above), `allStructs` needs `arg` to resolve, and
  `layoutDeps` needs it declared *earlier* — which is exactly
  `Reftype.layoutDep` and the checker's declared-earlier rule, the clause the
  single-table `GenWellFormed` never had to face.

/-! ## The struct table

`mangle` is a fold over characters with a keyword lookup, so leaving it to

recomputed. -/

`checkCtype` and `checkField` are concatenations, and the proof needs three of
their components separately. Pulling them out once keeps the case analysis
below readable, and puts the `++`-nesting in one place where a change to the
checker's clause order shows up as one broken pattern rather than five. -/

/-- Acceptance gives, for every ctype and every field of it: the field names of
that ctype are distinct, the `arg` resolves, a layout-carrying field's `arg`
was declared earlier, and an `Inlary`'s bound is a legal array size. -/

/-! ## Extending a well-formed struct table

`Llist`, `Thash` and `Pool` emit `addFields … (genStructs d)`, so
`checkStructs_gen` is no longer the whole struct obligation. This is the rest
of it, stated so a template supplies only facts about the fields **it** adds.

`layoutDeps = []` on every added field is a real restriction and a true one:
every field any template adds is a pointer, a `bool`, a `u32`, or an array of
pointers, and none of those carries layout. It is what keeps the
declared-earlier obligation from having to be re-established — `addFields`
does not reorder, so `earlier` is the same list it was. -/

`layoutWf` is `layoutCheck`, which is `Dmmeta.check` plus the no-empty-struct
clause; only the first half is used here, so the theorem is really about
`Dmmeta.check` and the empty-struct clause is what keeps the *output* legal C
rather than what keeps it well-formed in the subset's sense.
