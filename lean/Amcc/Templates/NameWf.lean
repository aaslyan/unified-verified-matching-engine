# AMCC — distinctness of generated function names

Obligation 1 asks that a translation unit's function names be pairwise
distinct. For the array table that was four names built from one schema, and
`ArrayTableWf` discharged it by hand. For the ctype-model templates the name
list is a **`flatMap` over fields**, one block of four (or five, or nine)
names per field, and the distinctness has to come from the schema's own
`<ctype>_<field>` uniqueness clause.

This module is that argument, once, for all three templates. It is here rather
than in whichever template needed it first because the shape is identical in
each: same `flatMap`, same qualified prefix, different literal suffixes.

## The two ways two generated names could collide

**Same field, different operation.** `q ++ "_Init"` versus `q ++ "_Get"`.
Cancelling the shared prefix leaves the suffixes, and `CSubset.append_ne`
already did this for the array table.

**Different fields.** `q ++ s` versus `q' ++ s'` with `q ≠ q'`. If `s = s'`
this is right-cancellation. If `s ≠ s'` it is *not* enough that the suffixes
differ — `q ++ "_Q"` and `q' ++ "_Get"` could in principle coincide with
`q' = q ++ "_Ge"`… except that they cannot, because reading both strings
**backwards** they disagree within the first two characters.

That is the trick `append_ne_rev` packages: reversing turns a suffix
comparison, which needs length reasoning, into a *prefix* comparison, which
`simp` decides by peeling `List.cons`. Each of the six suffix pairs a template
needs is then one `by simp`.

## Why the qualified names are distinct in the first place

`Dmmeta.check` has the clause: `c ++ "_" ++ f` is not injective in the pair —
ctype `a` with field `b_c` and ctype `a_b` with field `c` both qualify to
`a_b_c` — so the schema checker rejects the collision. That clause landed in
47ecf60 precisely so the accessor laws would not be vacuous; here it is what
makes the *whole program* well-formed rather than one function resolvable.

The templates each generate over a *filtered* subset of the fields, so what
descends is not the whole `qualNames` list but a **sublist** of it, and
`List.Pairwise.sublist` does the rest.

/-! ## Sublists

`Layout.pairwise_filterMap_map` proved the `Pairwise` consequence directly.
The `Sublist` form below is strictly more useful — it composes through the
outer `flatMap`, which the `Pairwise` form cannot. -/

yields a **sublist** of the projection. -/

The two obligations a block-structured name list has: each block is internally
distinct, and any two *different* blocks are disjointly distinct. -/

`checkStmt` on `row->f` needs `Ctx.field?` to resolve, which is two `find?`s:
the struct by ctype name, then the field by name. Both are "the first match in
a distinct-keyed list", which is `CSubset.find?_of_mem_pairwise`; what has to
be supplied is membership and the distinctness, and both come from the layout
proof. Shared, because all three templates dereference a row. -/
