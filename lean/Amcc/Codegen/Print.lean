# AMCC — Phase 4: printing the C subset as C

`Print.program` renders a `Program` as one C translation unit. This module is
the **trusted** half of Phase 4: nothing is proved about it, and it is kept
simple enough to audit by eye. The untrusted half is the differential harness
(`scripts/smoke.sh`), which compiles the printed C and replays the same call
sequences the Lean semantics answers in `ArrayTableChecks` — the two must
agree, which checks the printer and the C compiler's reading of it against
`execStmt` on concrete runs.

Printing decisions, all made for auditability rather than prettiness:

- **Every compound expression is parenthesised.** No precedence table exists
  to be wrong; the output is unambiguous by construction.
- **Every integer literal is suffixed** (`u` / `ull`), so no literal ever has
  a surprising promoted type in a comparison.
- **Declarators are printed by structural recursion** (`declare`): arrays
  append `[n]` to the declarator, pointers wrap it in `(*…)`. This is exactly
  C's inside-out declarator grammar, and it is what makes nested
  array-of-struct and pointer types come out right without special cases.
- **Structs are emitted with a tag *and* a typedef**, and struct types are
  printed using the tag (`struct row *p`). The tag is what makes a field
  pointing at its own struct legal — inside the definition the typedef does
  not exist yet — and intrusive links need exactly that.
- Globals are `static` (zero-initialised, internal linkage); functions are
  extern so a test driver can call them. **In the split output this changes**:
  a global declared in a header cannot be `static`, so `header`/`impl` emit
  `extern T g;` and `T g;` respectively.
- `if (c) { s }` with an absent else prints without an `else` branch:
  `Stmt.when` desugars to `.cond c s .skip`, and printing the `.skip` arm
  would be noise.

## Three entry points

`program` renders one self-contained translation unit — the original mode,
still what `lake exe amcc <schema>` prints. `header` and `impl` render the two
halves `Codegen.split` produces, laid out the way `amc`'s `<ns>_gen.h` and
`<ns>_gen.cpp` are: banner, include guard, declarations in the header;
banner, the header's `#include` as the first line, definitions in the
implementation. Which declarations reach which mode is `Codegen.Split`'s
business and is proved there; these two only render what they are handed.

`amc`'s banner is four comment lines — a blank one, the path, `Generated by
AMC`, a blank one — followed by the licence and `#pragma once`. AMCC's is the
same shape with the same include-guard mechanism; what the banner says is
different, because what AMCC generates comes with machine-checked statements
about it and that is the fact a reader of the file most needs. -/

itself. -/

    ++ "// See docs/GOALS.md.\n"
    ++ "//\n\n"

global as an `extern`, and one prototype per generated function — `amc`'s
header order, minus the sections AMCC has no analogue for. -/

    ++ String.intercalate "\n" (p.funs.map funProto)

/-- `<name>_gen.c`: the header's `#include` first, then the database global's
definition, then the bodies. `amc` prefixes each definition with a
`// --- <...>` marker; the AST carries the C name, so that is what the marker
carries. -/
