# AMCC — the ssim front end, exercised

There is no proof of the reader. What stands in for one, until there is, is the
**round trip**, and it is run here in both directions:

- `Db → text → Db` for every schema the generator actually uses. This is the
  sharper direction: it says the reader recovers *exactly* the term the
  templates were proved about, so a schema written as ssim and a schema written
  as a Lean term are the same input to every theorem in the repository.
- `text → Db → text` on hand-written text, which is the direction that catches
  a printer emitting something its own reader would reject.

Both are `rfl`, so they are kernel-checked equalities rather than sampled
tests.

The negative cases matter as much: a front end that accepts what the back end
cannot emit is the failure mode `docs/GOALS.md`'s standing rule exists to
prevent, so every rejection asserts the **exact** message, and a silently
weakened check fails visibly.

/-! ## The tuple layer

Quoting, escaping and the unquoted-colon split, which are where a
line-oriented reader goes wrong. -/

/-- A bare value needs no quotes; an empty one always does. `amc`'s
`PickSsimQuoteChar` is the rule.

checked by: `lake build` -/
example : printVal "task_row" = "task_row" := rfl
example : printVal "" = "\"\"" := rfl
example : printVal "a b" = "\"a b\"" := rfl

/-- `amc` picks whichever quote appears *less* often, so that fewer characters
need escaping. A value full of apostrophes is therefore printed in double
quotes, and one full of double quotes in single quotes.

checked by: `lake build` -/
example : printVal "it's" = "\"it's\"" := rfl
example : printVal "it's 'so'" = "\"it's 'so'\"" := rfl
example : printVal "say \"hi\"" = "'say \"hi\"'" := rfl

/-- A colon inside a quoted value does **not** split the attribute. This is the
one thing a naive `splitOn ":"` reader gets wrong, and it gets it wrong
silently.

backslash — the case that breaks a reader treating `\\` as one character.

/-! ## Qualified names

`dmmeta` names carry a namespace. The reader stores them **verbatim** — the
`Db` is the schema, not the C — and `Dmmeta.mangle` turns them into C
identifiers at the generator's boundary. So the round trip is unaffected by
mangling, which is the property this section pins. -/

#guard roundTrip qualText == .ok qualText

-- `Dmmeta.check` mangles every name, and `mangle` is a character fold with a

/-! ## The attribute join

The two tables go through one registry, so what is checked here is the
*mechanism*: a `dmmeta.smallstr` record reaches the model with its payload
intact and prints back byte-for-byte, on a schema whose field claims the
reftype that requires it. `Smallstr` is not in `supported` yet — the C subset
has no eight-bit scalar — so this is a `Db` term rather than ssim text going
in, and text is what comes back out. -/

/-- A `Smallstr` field with its `dmmeta.smallstr` record. Deliberately *not*
`Templates.Smallstr.Examples.strDb`: this one has no other field, so the
printed form below is the smallest thing that exercises the head. -/
def strDb : Db where
  ctypes :=
    [ { name := "Name"
      , fields := [{ name := "ch", arg := "char", reftype := .Smallstr }] } ]
  attrs := [{ ctype := "Name", field := "ch"
            , data := .smallstr 16 .rpascal "'0'" true }]

    "dmmeta.ctype  ctype:Name  comment:\"\"\n"

    ++ "dmmeta.smallstr  field:Name.ch  length:16  strtype:rpascal"
    ++ "  pad:\"'0'\"  strict:Y\n"

-- And reading it back is the identity, field record and attribute record
-- together — the join's own round trip, now that `Smallstr` is a reftype the
-- reader accepts.
-- checked by: `lake build`
#guard readDb (printDb strDb) == .ok strDb

/-- **The named error the join exists for.** A field claims a reftype whose
attribute record is missing, and the message names the table rather than the
reftype's own vocabulary — the same message `Bitfld`, `Charset` and the rest
will get for free.
