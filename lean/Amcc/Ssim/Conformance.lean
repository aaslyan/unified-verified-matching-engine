# AMCC — classifying a real `dmmeta` corpus

`docs/GOALS.md` measures AMCC against `amc`'s **actual capability**, and until
the ssim reader existed there was no way to say how far short of it the
generator falls except by counting reftypes by hand. This module is the
measurement: given `amc`'s own `data/dmmeta` as ssim text, it says of every
ctype and every field whether AMCC would generate code for it, would accept it
but emit nothing, or would reject it — and why.

## What is in Lean and what is not

Everything that decides a verdict is here, and reuses the shipping code:
`Ssim.parseFile` is the reader the round trip covers, `Ssim.supported` is the
same list `readReftype` refuses against, `Dmmeta.isCIdent` is the same
predicate `Dmmeta.check` applies. Nothing is re-implemented for the
measurement, so the numbers cannot drift from the generator.

`scripts/conformance/` is a throwaway Python pair that concatenates the
corpus and tallies the TSV this module prints. It decides nothing; if it
disappeared the verdicts would be unchanged.

## Why classification is not just "run the reader"

`Ssim.readDb` **aborts** on the first unsupported reftype, which is right for
a front end and useless for a census. This walks every tuple and records a
verdict per record instead, so one unsupported field does not hide the
thousands behind it.

`Dmmeta.mangle` existed this rejected every namespace-qualified name in the

question the checker asks: does the name *mangle* to a legal C identifier.
Characters no substitution rescues still fail, and say so. -/

/-- One TSV row: `kind`, `name`, the overall verdict and its reason, the
reftype, and then the two verdicts **separately**.

The last two columns are the point of the format. Reporting only the overall
verdict hides the most useful number in the census: a field can be blocked by
its reftype, by its name, or by both, and "how many fields would AMCC generate
if the naming question were solved" is answerable only if the two are kept
apart. -/
