# AMCC — ssim tuples into the `Dmmeta` model, and back

`Ssim.Tuple` knows the *format*; this module knows the *records*. It is the
second half of the front end and the place where the standing rule bites:

> **The reader must never run ahead of what the generator can produce.**

`dmmeta` declares thirty-five reftypes. AMCC has templates or a lowering for
eight of them. A reader that accepted the other twenty-seven would parse a
schema, hand it to `Dmmeta.check`, and get a `Db` for which nothing can be
emitted — or worse,
a `Db` whose unsupported fields are silently dropped, so what is generated is
provably correct about a schema the user did not write. `supported` below is
the list, each entry justified by the template or the lowering that consumes
it, and everything else is a named rejection.

## The record types

```
dmmeta.ctype     ctype:<name>                                   comment:""
dmmeta.field     field:<ctype>.<name>  arg:<ctype>  reftype:<R>  comment:""
dmmeta.inlary    field:<ctype>.<name>  min:0  max:<n>           comment:""
dmmeta.smallstr  field:<ctype>.<name>  length:<n>  strtype:<T>  pad:<c>  strict:<Y|N>
amcc.root        ctype:<name>                                   comment:""
```

The two attribute tables — `inlary` and `smallstr` — are read and written by
**one** pair of functions over `Dmmeta.AttrTag`, not one pair each. That is the
join: adding `bitfld`, `charset`, `lenfld`, `substr` or `fconst` is a payload
arm here and a payload arm in `Dmmeta`, and nothing else.

The first four are `amc`'s, key for key (`data/dmmeta/ctype.ssim`,
`field.ssim`, `inlary.ssim`, `smallstr.ssim`). The fourth is not: `amc` designates the database
ctype by the `<ns>.FDb` naming convention inside a namespace declared by
`dmmeta.nsdb`, and AMCC's `Dmmeta.Db` has no namespaces — a schema is a flat
list of ctypes with one of them named as the root. Reusing `dmmeta.nsdb` would
mean reading its `ns:` key as a ctype name, which is a reinterpretation
pretending to be a match. A separate head under our own namespace says what is
happening. Recorded in `docs/DIVERGENCE.md` §3.5.

## Ordering, because the round trip is byte-for-byte

`ofDb` emits the tuple heads in table order — every `dmmeta.ctype`, then every
`dmmeta.field`, then every attribute record in file order, then `amcc.root` —
which is what a concatenation of `amc`'s per-table files looks like. Within a head, schema
declaration order is preserved. `readDb` is insensitive to the interleaving of
heads (it makes two passes, so a field may precede its ctype), so the round
trip pins a *canonical* form rather than the only accepted one.

/-! ## What may be read

Each entry names the consumer that makes it emittable. Removing a template
should remove its line here, and adding one should add it — the point of the
list being in one place. -/

/-- The reftypes AMCC can act on. `Val`, `Base`, `Pkey`, `Upptr`, `Ptr` and
`Inlary` have a storage lowering (`Dmmeta.fieldTy`); `Thash` and `Llist` have
templates that emit their operations. The remaining twenty-seven of `dmmeta`'s
thirty-five are rejected by name.

`Smallstr` lowers to its `u8` array for all three `strtype`s, and `rpascal`
additionally gets operations — so it is supported in both senses the census
distinguishes. A padded field is *lowered*, not *generated*:
`Conformance.verdictOfReftype` says which, and `verdict_iff_supported` keeps
the two lists from drifting. -/
def supported : List Reftype :=
  Reftype.all

/-- Parse a reftype name, refusing the ones no template can emit. The two
failures are reported differently on purpose: an unknown name is a typo, an
unsupported one is a feature AMCC does not have yet, and a user needs to be
able to tell those apart. -/
def readReftype (s : String) : Except String Reftype :=
  match Reftype.ofName? s with
  | none   => .error s!"unknown reftype {s}"
  | some r =>
    if supported.contains r then .ok r
    else .error s!"reftype {s} is declared by dmmeta but no AMCC template emits it"

/-! ## Reading -/

/-- Split `<ctype>.<field>` at the **last** dot: `amc`'s ctype names are
themselves dotted (`abt.FBuilddir.select` is field `select` of ctype
`abt.FBuilddir`), so the last dot is the one that separates. -/
def splitQual (s : String) : Except String (String × String) :=
  match (splitOnChar '.' s.toList).reverse with
  | []            => .error s!"empty qualified name"
  | [_]           => .error s!"{s}: expected <ctype>.<field>"
  | f :: revOwner =>
    if f.isEmpty then .error s!"{s}: empty field name"
    else .ok (".".intercalate (revOwner.reverse.map String.ofList),
              String.ofList f)

/-- A required attribute, by name. -/
def need (t : Tuple) (k : String) : Except String String :=
  match t.get? k with
  | some v => .ok v

def readNat (s : String) : Except String Nat :=
  match digitsToNat? s.toList with
  | some n => .ok n
  | none   => .error s!"{s}: expected a number"

/-- What one pass accumulates. Kept as three lists rather than a partly-built
`Db` so that a field may be read before its ctype — the tuple order in a
concatenated ssim directory is by table, not by dependency. -/
structure Raw where
  ctypes : List Ident := []
  fields : List (Ident × Field) := []
  attrs  : List Dmmeta.Attr := []
  root   : Option Ident := none
  deriving Inhabited

/-- A builtin is not a declarable ctype: `Db.withBuiltins` supplies `u32`,
`u64` and `bool`, so declaring one would duplicate it. Rejecting is what keeps
`ofDb ∘ readDb` the identity — a reader that accepted and dropped them would
print back a shorter file. -/
def builtinNames : List Ident := builtins.map Ctype.name

/-! ### The attribute tables, once

`attrHeads` is the whole registry: a `dmmeta` head, the table it belongs to,
and how to read and write its payload. `readTuple` and `ofDb` consult it
rather than growing an arm per table, which is what makes the next attribute
record a data change instead of a code change. -/

  if s == "Y" then .ok true
  else if s == "N" then .ok false
  else .error s!"{s}: expected Y or N"

def readStrtype (s : String) : Except String Strtype :=
  match Strtype.ofName? s with
  | some t => .ok t
  | none   => .error s!"unknown strtype {s}"

/-- One attribute table's reader and writer, keyed by its `dmmeta` head. The
`field:` key is shared — it is what the join is on — so only the payload
differs, and only the payload appears here. -/
